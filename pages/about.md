# **About US-RSE Roles**

It's a hard task to define a research software engineer, as the role can emcompass a wide
set of skill sets and tasks. Since we don't have a good way to derive a single definition that everyone
can agree on, for now we are attacking the problem from a different angle. Instead
of trying to say exactly what an RSE does, this repository aims to collect examples
of job descriptions for RSEs. How might this small knowledge base eventually be
useful? It might help an individual or institution to create their own job description
to hire for, or it might be used as a dataset to understand what people are looking
for when they want to hire an RSE. For now, it's just a collection of descriptions,
and you should <a href="https://github.com/USRSE/rse-roles" target="_blank">read the repository readme</a>
to better understand how to contribute your own!
