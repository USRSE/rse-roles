## About the Job

The team you will join conquers new challenges each day. You might use Python one day, Swift the next, and the day after learn a new programming language you hadn't heard of before. Your skills will strengthen and diversify while you build an impressive and diverse portfolio of experiences, solutions, and skills. You will learn new academic and scientific subject areas and you will meet and form relationships with researchers from around the world who are Leaders and Best in their fields.

A typical day would see you meeting with a faculty member who has a new approach to solving a problem but lacks the programming skills to accomplish the task. You will work together to understand the problem, the goals, and the desired outcomes. As you will be part of a team that has your back, you may team up with a more senior programmer or another colleague to design a solution that accomplishes the goals and produces the desired outcomes within the time constraints of the research. You will then set to work creating the solution, working with your team for input, guidance, brainstorming, and sharing what you have learned along the way.

You will provide the appropriate type and amount of communication to satisfy your and the researcher's needs while you produce incremental deliverables and validate your work. You can present your solution to your peers for knowledge sharing and feedback. And you will spend time focusing on your own professional development.

## About You

We are looking for someone with a foundation of experiences and skills. You will need to be comfortable programming in either Python or Mobile Development for iOS or Android to get off to a good start.

We value clean coders who take the time to comment and document their work. Debugging skills, including the ability to debug someone else's code, will make you successful here as well. You'll work with people from many different cultures and backgrounds, some more technical than others, and each requiring you to develop relationships.

You could provide even more value to our team by having experience with research activities, version control systems, working across Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems, or any of the following languages and platforms: R, C, , Arduino, Serial or IP communication, Database development and SQL, JavaScript, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality development, machine learning, or GUI development. However, if these are not already in your wheelhouse, you can consider each of them to be growth opportunities once you join our team.

You might have a CS degree. You might not. That's not what we're looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.

##Required Qualifications*

- At least 1 year of experience working with complex programming projects (multiple functions or classes)
- Experience developing solutions using either Python or Mobile Development for iOS or Android

##Desired Qualifications*

- Comfortable in Mac, Windows and Linux environments
- Experience working directly with faculty in a research lab setting
- Experience with any of the following:
- R, C, Arduino, Serial or IP communication, Database development and SQL, JavaScript, AR/VR development, machine learning, GUI development, Arduino or similar

## Additional Information

### WORK LOCATION

You will work from our main Central Campus location, giving you ready access to our abundant University resources. You will also be able to work with your manager to select one to two days a week to work from home.

### WORK HOURS

We will not work you to tears, burn you out, or make you choose between work and important family events. Our goal is for you to maintain a healthy relationship between life and work. Most of our team works 8 hours per day, Monday through Friday. Our team does not typically work late, work weekends, or have to come in early. Our work is flexible enough to be predictable and adjustable. The University of Michigan also offers tuition reimbursement, vacation, sick, and parental leave benefits including up to six weeks of paid parental leave to all eligible parents and legal guardians to bond with a new child.
